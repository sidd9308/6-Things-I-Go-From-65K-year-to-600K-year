# 6 Things I Go From $65K/year to $600K/year

Revealing the step-by-step 👇🏼
on how I started 2023 making $65k/year and am ending it having made over $600k.

First things first, don’t let my results fool you into thinking I’m someone special. I was a burnt out 9-5er looking for a way out. I started with zero experience, zero followers, and no relevant degree.

Here’s the step-by-step:


1️⃣ Pick a niche.

2️⃣ Apply to affiliate programs within your niche. How? 👉🏼 Google “your niche” + affiliate program & apply.

3️⃣ Create a freebie. Such as “10 ways to travel alone safely” if you’re in the travel niche. Use Canva to create it for free.

4️⃣ Create a 2-page sales funnel (opt-in + bridge page).

5️⃣ Create an email campaign.

6️⃣ Post valuable content daily on social media (or other platform), driving traffic to your links.

👇🏼HERE’S THE BEST PART👇🏼

80% of that is done ONCE! Set your automated systems up ONE time and they will run for you 24/7.

This business model made me $100k in my first 4.5 months, working from my phone.

If this sounds like Chinese algebra to you, that’s okay! I felt the same way 9 months ago. All of this was foreign to me 😆
